# We’re for the gamers

You fire up your PC and start your favourite game. The connection speed is decent, but your ping is 45ms and rubberbanding all over the place. *Wait*, **what?**

Unlike other ISPs, Zeno puts gamers first. We offer great connection speeds and ultra-low latency, all the time. Fun just got a lot more **serious**.
