## FAQ


#### Does your bonded service work on Telstra DSLAMS?

*Yes!* It very much does. Our bonded service even works if you are on a rim, provided there are spare ports.

-------------------------

#### Do you have data limits?

No! We believe you should pay for the speed at which you download, not how much you download.

-------------------------

#### Who's network do you use for ADSL Services?

We use the iiNet, AAPT, Optus, Telstra and Powertel DSLAM's across australia to provide the best possible service to our customers.

-------------------------

#### Do you support Annex-M?

On certain DSLAMS we do support Annex-M. If you are on an annex-M DSLAM we will switch it on by default. 

-------------------------

#### Do you offer static IP's?

Yes, we do offer 1 free static IP address per customer. Just ask us or select the Add-on via your customer Portal.
